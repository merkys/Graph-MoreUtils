=head1 NAME

Graph::Line - generate line graphs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Graph::Line;
    use Graph::Undirected;

    my $G = Graph::Undirected->new;

    # Greate graph here

    # Get line graph for $G:
    my $L = Graph::Line->new( $G );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Graph::Line generates line graphs for
L<Graph::Undirected|Graph::Undirected> objects. Constructor C<new> is
the only overridden method, constructing (nondestructively) a line
graph for input graph. Both simple and multiedged graphs are supported.

Constructor C<new> accepts additional options hash. Currently only one
option is supported, C<loop_end_vertices>, which treats the input graph
as having self-loops on pendant vertices, that is, increasing the
degrees of vertices having degrees of 1. Thus they are not "lost"
during line graph construction. In the resulting line graph these
self-loops are represented as instances of
L<Graph::Line::SelfLoopVertex|Graph::Line::SelfLoopVertex>.
