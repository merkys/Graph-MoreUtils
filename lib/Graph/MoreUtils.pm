=head2 C<SSSR( $graph, $max_depth )>

Finds the Smallest Set of Smallest Rings (SSSR) in L<Graph> objects.
Thus it should work with any L<Graph::Undirected> object.
The code is largely taken from the C<cod-tools> package (L<https://wiki.crystallography.net/cod-tools/>).

The algorithm returns a superset of minimum cycle basis of a graph in order to produce deterministic results.
As a result it does not succumb to the counterexample of oxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (L<https://depth-first.com/articles/2020/08/31/a-smallest-set-of-smallest-rings/>, section "SSSR and Uniqueness").
The algorithm has means to control the maximum size of rings included in the SSSR to reduce its complexity.
The default value of C<undef> stands for no limit.

sub SSSR { &Graph::MoreUtils::SSSR::SSSR }

=head2 C<graph_replace( $graph, $new, @old )>

Replaces one or more vertices (C<@old>) in the graph with a given one (C<$new>).
All edges between the replaced vertices are removed and all edges with other vertices become a reconnected to the new one.

sub graph_replace { &Graph::MoreUtils::Replace::replace }

=head2 C<line( $graph )>

Generates line graphs for L<Graph::Undirected> objects.
Line graph is constructed nondestructively and returned from the call.
Both simple and multiedged graphs are supported.

Call accepts additional options hash.
Currently only one option is supported, C<loop_end_vertices>, which treats the input graph as having self-loops on pendant vertices, that is, increasing the degrees of vertices having degrees of 1.
Thus they are not "lost" during line graph construction.
In the resulting line graph these self-loops are represented as instances of L<Graph::MoreUtils::Line::SelfLoopVertex>.

sub line { &Graph::MoreUtils::Line::line }

=head2 C<smooth( $graph )>

Smooths the given graph by collating vertices of degree 2.
